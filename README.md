Proposal Management System
Introduction
This Proposal Management System is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to register and login, view available proposals, filter them based on category, budget, price, and language, add proposals to their cart, and bookmark interesting proposals. Additionally, users can add new proposals, view them in the proposal list, and manage them.
